# Tutorial 1

This introductory tutorial will focus primarily on helping you get your environment set up for future code development. We will also walk through an example to (a) load in a new dataset and (b) render a simple HTML table to the browser.

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to get comfortable with the [Github workflow](../GIT_SETUP.md), and with using their [local development environment](../README.md).
- to understand how to load in a dataset using [d3-fetch](https://github.com/d3/d3-fetch) (d3.json, d3.csv, etc.).
- to introduce [d3-selections](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/) and [d3 data binding](https://observablehq.com/@d3/selection-join).
- to give the tools to create a simple [HTML table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table).

## How to setup, serve, and deploy:

Start with our setup flow -- this includes [installations](../README.md#setup), the [git setup](../GIT_SETUP.md) (forking, cloning, setting upstream, etc.) and getting a [basic server](../BASIC_SERVER.md) up and running.

Once your installations are complete and you're ready to begin working on your tutorial assignment, use your terminal (or git bash, on PC) to navigate to the _root directory_ of your fork. Your path may look different, but the command will be something like this:

```sh
$ cd Documents/My\ Repositories/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2020/
```

From this level, (_not from the tutorial folder_), run:

```sh
$ serve
``` 

When you open `http://localhost:5000/`, you should see your repository's folder structure. 

You can view your **tutorial site** at `http://localhost:5000/TUTORIAL_PATH/`. 

You can view our class **demo site** at `http://localhost:5000/TUTORIAL_PATH/demo/`.

(note: make sure to change `TUTORIAL_PATH`). 

As you're working on the assignment, you can always reference the [demo code](demo/).

### Deploy

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. Post the link to your deployed example as a comment to the appropriate post on the Commons. (Note: your link will look something like: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Sp2020/TUTORIAL_PATH/`)

To receive full credit, you must post your stable path before the start of the next class.

## Week 1 Assignment:

- [ ] Replicate the process for **your own dataset**. This will involve finding/creating a suitable dataset, saving it somewhere in your repository, and writing the code. You should leverage the files present in the root of this directory (`tutorial1_intro/` [index.html](index.html), [style.css](style.css), [main.js](main.js))
- [ ] Update the table's conditional formatting to highlight something meaningful for your new dataset. This may include changing the logic for the cell's [class](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_classed), adding another [attribute](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_attr), or directly augmenting the cell's [style](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_style).

My own data set from: https://whoownswhat.justfix.nyc

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Add logic to update the appearance of an _entire row_ (not just a single cell).
- [ ] Add a summary row for totals/averages of your data.
